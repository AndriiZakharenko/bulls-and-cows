# The "Bulls & Cows" Game

## 🎮 About the Project
I implemented the "Bulls and Cows" game, where the user can play directly from the command line. The game involves the computer generating a secret number, and the user tries to guess it. For each guess, the game returns feedback in the form of "bulls" (correct digits in the correct position) and "cows" (correct digits in the wrong position).

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (For building the backend logic of the game)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For maintaining code quality and consistency  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing the game logic  

## 📌 Features
✅ Command-line interface for user interaction  
✅ Game logic includes "bulls" and "cows" feedback for each guess  
✅ User can continue guessing until they find the correct number  

## 🌐 Demo
Since this is a command-line game, you can try it locally by running the Node.js script.
